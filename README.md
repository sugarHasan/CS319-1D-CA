#### **What is Catan?**

Catan is a strategy board game in which players gather resources and them to construct cities, roads and settlements to win the game. 


#### **How to play?**

Terrain hexes and Tokens are arbitrarily placed in order to make each game somewhat unique from the next. Desert hex should not have any token, instead grey robber must be placed to it. Every player collects their colored game pieces which  are settlements, cities and roads. There are five sorts of resource cards each with their own pile and there is likewise a deck of development cards which give the players various advantages. Each player places two settlements and two roads. Settlements can be placed on hex corners if the three surrounding corners are empty.  Roads can be placed on hex edges. Roads and settlements must always be connected. Each type of terrain produces a different resources. Hill's produce bricks, field's produce grain, pasture's produce wool, wood's produce lumber and mountain's make ore. Each player takes the appropriate resources by looking at their surrounding hexes. Each player starts their turn by rolling two dice. If players want, they can exchange their resources by each other. In. the event. that nobody needs to trait. than player can trade four of similar resources by new one. There is a building costs card that tells players what resources players need. Player can build roads, settlements or upgrade your settlements to cities which collect twice as many resources. Players can buy development cards for random advantages. Players can win the game by earning ten victory points. Each settlement is worth one victory points, each city is  worth two. If players roll a seven, robber can move to another hex than player can choose anyone with a settlement bordering that hex  and steal one resource card from there and also hex will not produce any resources until the robber is moved again.
